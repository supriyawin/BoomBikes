## General Information
- Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Dataset being used is day.csv

## Conclusions
- Apparent Temperature (atemp,temp): Positive impact, highest coefficien
- Weather Situation: Light Snow (weathersit_Light Snow): Strong negative impact.
- Season: Spring (season_spring): Strong negative impact.

## Technologies Used
The analysis will be conducted using Python programming language and its libraries, including:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **sklearn.linear_model** for modelling.
- **sklearn.metrics** for r2 score.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive development and documentation.

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
